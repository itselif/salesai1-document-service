# Service Design Specification
**salesai-platformadmin-service** documentation
-Version:**`1.0.0`**

## Scope

This document provides a structured architectural overview of the `platformAdmin` microservice, detailing its configuration, data model, authorization logic, business rules, and API design. It has been automatically generated based on the service definition within Mindbricks, ensuring that the information reflects the source of truth used during code generation and deployment.

The document is intended to serve multiple audiences:

* **Service architects** can use it to validate design decisions and ensure alignment with broader architectural goals.
* **Developers and maintainers** will find it useful for understanding the structure and behavior of the service, facilitating easier debugging, feature extension, and integration with other systems.
* **Stakeholders and reviewers** can use it to gain a clear understanding of the service's capabilities and domain logic.

> **Note for Frontend Developers**: While this document is valuable for understanding business logic and data interactions, please refer to the [Service API Documentation](#) for endpoint-level specifications and integration details.

> **Note for Backend Developers**: Since the code for this service is automatically generated by Mindbricks, you typically won't need to implement or modify it manually. However, this document is especially valuable when you're building other services—whether within Mindbricks or externally—that need to interact with or depend on this service. It provides a clear reference to the service's data contracts, business rules, and API structure, helping ensure compatibility and correct integration.



## `PlatformAdmin` Service Settings [**Edit**](platformadmin/serviceSettings)

Platform-wide backend administration: OpenAPI schema/versioning, system health checks, CI/CD, repo/cache backend switching, seed/test data operations, JWT/session config &amp; rotation, API/WebSocket auth monitoring, global config control. Coordinates and logs all admin operations; RBAC and stores managed in auth/store services.

### Service Overview

This service is configured to listen for HTTP requests on port `3006`, 
serving both the main API interface and default administrative endpoints.

The following routes are available by default:

* **API Test Interface (API Face):** `/`
* **Swagger Documentation:** `/swagger`
* **Postman Collection Download:** `/getPostmanCollection`
* **Health Checks:** `/health` and `/admin/health`
* **Current Session Info:** `/currentuser`
* **Favicon:** `/favicon.ico`

The service uses a **PostgreSQL** database for data storage, with the database name set to `salesai-platformadmin-service`.

This service is accessible via the following environment-specific URLs:

* **Preview:** `https://platformAdmin-api.salesai1.prw.mindbricks.com`
* **Staging:** `https://platformAdmin-api.salesai1.staging.mindbricks.com`
* **Production:** `https://platformAdmin-api.salesai1.prod.mindbricks.com`

                                 

### Authentication & Security
- **Login Required**: Yes

This service requires user authentication for access. It supports both JWT and RSA-based authentication mechanisms, ensuring secure user sessions and data integrity.
If a crud route also is configured to require login, 
it will check a valid JWT token in the request query/header/bearer/cookie. If the token is valid, it will extract the user information from the token and make the fetched session data available in the request context.

  
### Service Data Objects
The service uses a **PostgreSQL** database for data storage, with the database name set to `salesai-platformadmin-service`.

Data deletion is managed using a **soft delete** strategy. Instead of removing records from the database, they are flagged as inactive by setting the `isActive` field to `false`.



| Object Name | Description | Public Access | Tenant Level  | 
|-------------|-------------|---------------| --------------| 
| `openApiSchema` | Stores current and historical OpenAPI schema definitions for all APIs, including versioning and description metadata. | No |  No | 
| `platformAdminShareToken` | A data object that stores the share tokens for tokenized access to shared objects. | No |  Yes | 




## openApiSchema Data Object

### Object Overview
**Description:** Stores current and historical OpenAPI schema definitions for all APIs, including versioning and description metadata.

This object represents a core data structure within the service and acts as the blueprint for database interaction, API generation, and business logic enforcement. 
It is defined using the `ObjectSettings` pattern, which governs its behavior, access control, caching strategy, and integration points with other systems such as Stripe and Redis.

### Core Configuration
- **Soft Delete:** Enabled — Determines whether records are marked inactive (`isActive = false`) instead of being physically deleted.
- **Public Access:** No — If enabled, anonymous users may access this object’s data depending on route-level rules.
- **Tenant-Level Scope:** No — Enables data isolation per tenant by attaching a tenant ID field.




### Composite Indexes

- **unique_version**: [version] 
This composite index is defined to optimize query performance for complex queries involving multiple fields.

The index also defines a conflict resolution strategy for duplicate key violations.

When a new record would violate this composite index, the following action will be taken:

**On Duplicate**: `throwError`

An error will be thrown, preventing the insertion of conflicting data.






### Properties Schema

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `version` | String | Yes | Schema version (e.g., &#39;v1.0.3&#39;). |
| `description` | Text | No | Description/notes about this schema version. |
| `schemaJson` | Text | Yes | Raw OpenAPI schema JSON (stringified). |
* Required properties are mandatory for creating objects and must be provided in the request body if no default value is set.



### Default Values
Default values are automatically assigned to properties when a new object is created, if no value is provided in the request body.
Since default values are applied on db level, they should be literal values, not expressions.If you want to use expressions, you can use transposed parameters in any crud route to set default values dynamically.

- **version**: v1


### Constant Properties

`version`

Constant properties are defined to be immutable after creation, meaning they cannot be updated or changed once set. They are typically used for properties that should remain constant throughout the object's lifecycle.
A property is set to be constant if the `Allow Update` option is set to `false`.


### Auto Update Properties

`description` `schemaJson`

An update crud route created with the option `Auto Params` enabled will automatically update these properties with the provided values in the request body. 
If you want to update any property in your own business logic not by user input, you can set the `Allow Auto Update` option to false.
These properties will be added to the update route's body parameters and can be updated by the user if any value is provided in the request body.

 

 

 

### Elastic Search Indexing

`version` `description`

Properties that are indexed in Elastic Search will be searchable via the Elastic Search API. 
While all properties are stored in the elastic search index of the data object, only those marked for Elastic Search indexing will be available for search queries.


### Database Indexing

`version`

Properties that are indexed in the database will be optimized for query performance, allowing for faster data retrieval.
Make a property indexed in the database if you want to use it frequently in query filters or sorting.


### Unique Properties

`version`

Unique properties are enforced to have distinct values across all instances of the data object, preventing duplicate entries.
Note that a unique property is automatically indexed in the database so you will not need to set the `Indexed in DB` option.









### Filter Properties

`version` `description`

Filter properties are used to define parameters that can be used in query filters, allowing for dynamic data retrieval based on user input or predefined criteria.
These properties are automatically mapped as route parameters in the listing CRUD routes that have "Auto Params" enabled.

- **version**: String  has a filter named `version`

- **description**: Text  has a filter named `description`





## platformAdminShareToken Data Object

### Object Overview
**Description:** A data object that stores the share tokens for tokenized access to shared objects.

This object represents a core data structure within the service and acts as the blueprint for database interaction, API generation, and business logic enforcement. 
It is defined using the `ObjectSettings` pattern, which governs its behavior, access control, caching strategy, and integration points with other systems such as Stripe and Redis.

### Core Configuration
- **Soft Delete:** Enabled — Determines whether records are marked inactive (`isActive = false`) instead of being physically deleted.
- **Public Access:** No — If enabled, anonymous users may access this object’s data depending on route-level rules.
- **Tenant-Level Scope:** Yes — Enables data isolation per tenant by attaching a tenant ID field.








### Properties Schema

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `configName` | String | Yes | A string value to represent the related configuration of the shared token. |
| `objectName` | String | Yes | A string value to represent the type name of the shared object like `report`, `document`. |
| `objectId` | ID | Yes | An ID value to represent the shared target data object instance. |
| `ownerId` | ID | Yes | An ID value to represent the user who shared the object by creating this token. |
| `peopleOption` | String | Yes | A string value to represent the access option of the share token. It can be either anyoneWithLink or specificEmails. |
| `tokenPermissions` |  | Yes | A string array to store the names of  permissions (or roles)  by the sharing user. |
| `allowedEmails` |  | Yes | A string array to store the allowed emails if the peopleOption is specificEmails. |
| `expireDate` | Date | Yes | A date value to specify the expire date of the token. Null for infinite token. |
| `storeId` | ID | Yes | An ID value to represent the tenant id of the store |
* Required properties are mandatory for creating objects and must be provided in the request body if no default value is set.



### Default Values
Default values are automatically assigned to properties when a new object is created, if no value is provided in the request body.
Since default values are applied on db level, they should be literal values, not expressions.If you want to use expressions, you can use transposed parameters in any crud route to set default values dynamically.

- **storeId**: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000


### Constant Properties

`configName` `objectName` `objectId` `ownerId` `peopleOption` `tokenPermissions` `allowedEmails` `expireDate` `storeId`

Constant properties are defined to be immutable after creation, meaning they cannot be updated or changed once set. They are typically used for properties that should remain constant throughout the object's lifecycle.
A property is set to be constant if the `Allow Update` option is set to `false`.


 

 

 

### Elastic Search Indexing

`configName` `objectName` `objectId` `ownerId` `peopleOption` `tokenPermissions` `allowedEmails` `expireDate` `storeId`

Properties that are indexed in Elastic Search will be searchable via the Elastic Search API. 
While all properties are stored in the elastic search index of the data object, only those marked for Elastic Search indexing will be available for search queries.


### Database Indexing

`configName` `objectId` `ownerId` `storeId`

Properties that are indexed in the database will be optimized for query performance, allowing for faster data retrieval.
Make a property indexed in the database if you want to use it frequently in query filters or sorting.





### Secondary Key Properties

`storeId`

Secondary key properties are used to create an additional indexed identifiers for the data object, allowing for alternative access patterns.
Different than normal indexed properties, secondary keys will act as primary keys and Mindbricks will provide automatic secondary key db utility functions to access the data object by the secondary key.



### Session Data Properties

`ownerId`

Session data properties are used to store data that is specific to the user session, allowing for personalized experiences and temporary data storage.
If a property is configured as session data, it will be automatically mapped to the related field in the user session during CRUD operations.
Note that session data properties can not be mutated by the user, but only by the system.

- **ownerId**: ID property will be mapped to the session parameter `userId`.

This property is also used to store the owner of the session data, allowing for ownership checks and access control.





### Filter Properties

`configName` `objectName` `objectId` `ownerId` `peopleOption` `tokenPermissions` `allowedEmails` `expireDate` `storeId`

Filter properties are used to define parameters that can be used in query filters, allowing for dynamic data retrieval based on user input or predefined criteria.
These properties are automatically mapped as route parameters in the listing CRUD routes that have "Auto Params" enabled.

- **configName**: String  has a filter named `configName`

- **objectName**: String  has a filter named `objectName`

- **objectId**: ID  has a filter named `objectId`

- **ownerId**: ID  has a filter named `ownerId`

- **peopleOption**: String  has a filter named `peopleOption`
